    "Multiple inheritance in Python refers to the ability of a class to inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. This means that a subclass can inherit from two or more superclasses.\n",
    "In multiple inheritance, a single subclass can inherit properties from multiple parent classes, allowing for the combination of different behaviors and functionalities.  \n",
    "This can be useful in situations where a class needs to inherit characteristics from multiple sources or exhibit multiple types of behavior.  \n",
    "However, multiple inheritance can also introduce complexity and ambiguity, especially when there are conflicts between methods or attributes inherited from different parent classes. For example, the \"diamond problem\" is a common issue in multiple inheritance where it becomes ambiguous as to which parent class a particular feature is inherited from if more than one parent class implements the same feature.   \n",
    "To address such issues, programming languages like Python provide mechanisms such as method resolution order (MRO) and super() to handle conflicts and ensure proper inheritance resolution.   \n",
    "These mechanisms help in resolving conflicts and determining the order in which methods are called.  \n",
    "It's important to note that while multiple inheritance is supported in Python, some other languages like Java do not support it directly. In Java, multiple inheritance of classes is not allowed, but multiple inheritance can be achieved through interfaces.\n",
    "In summary, multiple inheritance in Python allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from multiple parent classes. It provides flexibility in combining behaviors and functionalities, but it can also introduce complexity and conflicts that need to be managed carefully."

    "Delegation is an object-oriented programming technique that allows an object to delegate some of its responsibilities to another object. In delegation, an object passes on a method call to another object that performs the actual behavior of the method.      This allows for greater flexibility and modularity in object-oriented design, as objects can be composed of other objects to achieve complex behaviors and functionalities.      \n",
    "In Python, delegation can be achieved through the use of the \\__getattr__() method. This method is called when an attribute or method is not found in an object, allowing the object to delegate the method call to another object.  \n",
