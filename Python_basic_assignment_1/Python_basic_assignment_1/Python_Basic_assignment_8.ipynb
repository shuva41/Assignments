Here's why:\n","\n","- **Clarity**: `pypi` actually refers to the Python Package Index, which is the official repository for third-party Python packages. Using it as an alias for PyInputPlus can be confusing.\n","\n","- **Conciseness**: A more common approach is to use a shorter alias like `pyip`. This saves you from typing the entire module name every time you want to use a function from PyInputPlus.\n","\n","Here's a corrected example:"],"metadata":{"id":"mklD6T3tekSv"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import PyInputplus as pyip\n","\n","# Now you can use functions like pyip.inputStr() or pyip.inputInt()"],"metadata":{"id":"5R-xtNA2evnz"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["3. How do you distinguish between inputInt() and inputFloat()?"],"metadata":{"id":"y3yUS6izazLJ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Both `inputInt()` and `inputFloat()` are functions likely from the external library PyInputPlus, used for getting user input with some added functionalities compared to the built-in `input()` function. Here's how they differ:\n","\n","1. **Input Validation**:\n","\n","  - `inputInt()`: This function specifically restricts the user input to be an integer value (whole numbers). It will keep prompting the user until they enter a valid integer.\n","\n","  - `inputFloat()`: This function allows the user to enter either an integer or a floating-point number (numbers with decimals). It will accept both as valid input.\n","\n","2.  **Return Value**:\n","\n","  - `inputInt()`: This function successfully converts and returns the user's input as an integer data type.\n","\n","  - `inputFloat()`: This function successfully converts and returns the user's input as a float data type, even if the user entered an integer.\n","\n","In summary, use `inputInt()` when you specifically need whole numbers and `inputFloat()` when you want to accept both integers and decimals."],"metadata":{"id":"sE0f8jlTfJNs"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["4.

Import PyInputPlus: We import the library using import pyinputplus as pyip for easier use.\n","2. Loop: We use a while True loop to keep prompting the user until they enter a valid number.\n","3. inputInt: We use pyip.inputInt to get user input as an integer.\n","4. Validation: We set min=0 and max=99 arguments to restrict the valid input range.\n","5. Break: Inside the loop, we check if the entered value (user_input) is within the valid range (0 to 99) using an if statement. If it is, the loop breaks, and we exit the loop.\n","6. Error Handling: If the input is invalid, an error message is printed using print, and the loop continues, prompting the user again.\n","7. Valid Input: Once the loop breaks (due to valid input), the entered number is stored in the user_input variable.\n","8. Confirmation: Finally, the program confirms the user's valid input using another print statement.\n","\n","This code ensures that the user enters a whole number between 0 and 99 before continuing with your program."],"metadata":{"id":"i3ti5y9sgcPi"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["5. What is transferred to the keyword arguments allowRegexes and blockRegexes?"],"metadata":{"id":"LDUy6ms-azF_"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The `allowRegexes` and `blockRegexes` arguments in PyInputPlus are used for regular expression based validation of user input. They can accept the following:\n","\n","1. **Strings**: You can directly transfer a string containing a valid regular expression enclosed in raw strings (prefixed with `r`). This regex defines the pattern that the user input must match (for `allowRegexes`) or not match (for `blockRegexes`) to be considered valid.\n","\n","2. **List of Strings**: You can also transfer a list of strings, where each string represents a separate regular expression. The input will be considered valid if it matches any of the provided regular expressions in `allowRegexes` or fails to match any in `blockRegexes`.\n","\n","Here's a breakdown of what gets transferred:\n","\n","- **allowRegexes**:\n","\n","  - This argument expects a string containing a valid regular expression (e.g., `r'\\d+'` for digits) or a list of strings containing multiple regular expressions.\n","  - The user input is considered valid only if it matches at least one of the provided regular expressions.\n","\n","- **blockRegexes**:\n","\n","  - This argument also expects a string containing a regular expression or a list of strings with regular expressions.\n","  - The user input is considered invalid if it matches any of the provided regular expressions in `blockRegexes`.\n","\n","**Important Note**:\n","\n","  - Remember that regular expressions can be complex. Make sure you understand how to write the desired pattern before using them in `allowRegexes` or `blockRegexes`. There are many resources available online for learning regular expressions.\n","  \n","By using these arguments effectively, you can ensure that the user enters data that conforms to your specific requirements."],"metadata":{"id":"3aCC4KDlgm85"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["6. If a blank input is entered three times, what does `inputStr(limit=3)` do?"],"metadata":{"id":"Qc8OJM9mazDh"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["If a blank input is entered three times consecutively when using `inputStr(limit=3)`, the function from PyInputPlus will most likely raise a `RetryLimitException`.\n","\n","Here's why:\n","\n","- `inputStr`: This function from PyInputPlus is designed to get user input as a string.\n","\n","- `limit=3`: This argument specifies the maximum number of attempts the user gets to provide valid input. In this case, the user has 3 tries.\n","\n","- **Blank Input**: When the user enters an empty string (pressing Enter without typing anything), it's considered blank input.\n","\n","- **RetryLimitException**: If the user enters a blank input three times consecutively (reaching the limit set by `limit=3`), PyInputPlus will likely raise a `RetryLimitException`. This exception indicates that the user has exceeded the allowed number of retries for providing valid input.\n","\n","**Possible Variations**:\n","\n","- The specific exception name might vary depending on the exact implementation of PyInputPlus. It could be named slightly differently, but it will still convey the concept of exceeding the retry limit.\n","\n","- Some implementations might provide an option to customize the exception message or behavior upon encountering blank inputs.\n","\n","Overall, encountering three blank inputs consecutively signifies that the user is not providing valid input, and PyInputPlus raises an exception to signal this issue to your program. You can handle this exception in your code to provide informative messages to the user and guide them towards entering a valid string."],"metadata":{"id":"gKQXLUB2hshx"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["7.

The user enters a blank input.\n","2. PyInputPlus prompts the user again, reminding them of the limit (e.g., `\"2 attempts remaining\"`).\n","3. This repeats for two more blank inputs, reaching the limit set by `limit=3`.\n","4. Since a default value (`\"hello\"`) is provided, PyInputPlus does not raise an exception.\n","5. Instead, it returns the default value (`\"hello\"`) as the user's input.\n","\n","**Key Point**:\n","\n","The default value acts as a fallback mechanism to prevent your program from getting stuck waiting for valid input if the user keeps entering blanks.\n","\n","**Possible Variations**:\n","\n","Some implementations of PyInputPlus might allow you to specify different behaviors upon encountering blank inputs.
