To what does a relative path refer?"],"metadata":{"id":"x_xhTLtOkXjO"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["In Python, a relative path refers to the location of a file or directory described relative to the current working directory (CWD) where your script is running. It's a shorthand way to avoid specifying the entire absolute path on your system.\n","\n","Here's a breakdown of how it works:\n","\n","- **Current Working Directory (CWD)**: This is the directory that your Python script is executing in at the moment.\n","- **Relative Path**: The path you specify that navigates from the CWD to the target file or directory.\n","\n","There are three common ways to construct relative paths:\n","\n","1. `.` **(current directory)**: A single dot refers to the current directory itself.\n","2. `..` **(parent directory)**: Two dots represent the parent directory of the CWD.\n","3. **Filename (within CWD)**: If you just specify a filename without any prefixes, it's assumed to be in the current directory.\n","\n","Here are some examples to illustrate:\n","\n","- `data.txt` - This refers to a file named \"data.txt\" within the CWD.\n","- `./images/logo.png` - This points to a file named \"logo.png\" inside a subdirectory called \"images\" relative to the CWD.\n","- `../config.ini` - This navigates up one directory (parent of CWD) and then points to a file named \"config.ini\".\n","\n","Using relative paths makes your code more portable and easier to manage within your project structure.

What does an absolute path start with your operating system?"],"metadata":{"id":"6cTs0tIskXls"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["An absolute path in an operating system starts with the root directory, which acts as the  foundation of the entire file system.\n","\n","The way it's represented differs between operating systems:\n","\n","- **Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS)**: The root directory is denoted by a forward slash (`/`). For instance, an absolute path to a file named `report.txt` on your desktop might be `/Users/your_username/Desktop/report.txt`.\n","- **Windows**: The root directory is indicated by a drive letter followed by a backslash (`\\`). Absolute paths typically start with the drive letter (e.g., `C:`) followed by backslashes separating directory names. An example would be `C:\\Users\\your_username\\Desktop\\report.txt`.\n","\n","In essence, an absolute path provides the complete roadmap from the root directory to the specific file or directory you're referencing,  regardless of your current working directory.

What data structure does a shelf value resemble?"],"metadata":{"id":"Z-D1h39bkuLY"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["A shelf value in Python most closely resembles a dictionary.

You can use them to save data to a disk file and retrieve it later, even after restarting your program.\n","\n","- **Dictionaries**:  Dictionaries are a fundamental data structure in Python that store data as key-value pairs. Each key is unique and acts as an identifier for its corresponding value. Dictionaries allow for efficient retrieval and modification of data based on the keys.\n","\n","The resemblance between shelf values and dictionaries lies in their key-value nature:\n","\n","- **Keys**: Both shelves and dictionaries use unique keys to access and associate values.\n","- **Values**: They can store various data types as values, including strings, numbers, lists, or even custom objects.\n","\n","**Key Differences**:\n","\n","- **Persistence**: Shelves are persistent, meaning changes are saved to a file on disk. Dictionaries are not persistent and reside only in memory.\n","- **Performance**: For small datasets, dictionaries might offer slightly faster performance due to their in-memory nature. However, for larger datasets or persistent storage needs, shelves become a better choice.\n","\n","In essence, if you need a persistent dictionary-like data structure to store and retrieve information across program executions, a shelf is the way to go."],"metadata":{"id":"ioOrd9QfqXmj"}}]}
