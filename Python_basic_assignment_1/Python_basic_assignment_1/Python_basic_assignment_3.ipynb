    "    Using functions keeps the code more readable, and easier to maintain (in case it is required to make any changes, it can be done easily without getting many errors).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Complex problems are broken down into smaller problems:  \n",
    "    For example, when we are creating a single program to represent a calculator, then we can create seperate functions to perform addition, substraction, multiplication, division and other mathematical operations. This brings clarity to the overall logic of the program.\n",
    "4. Information hiding:   \n",
