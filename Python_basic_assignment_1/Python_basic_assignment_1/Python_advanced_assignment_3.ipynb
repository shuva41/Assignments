    "An abstract superclass in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated and serves as a blueprint for other classes.  \n",
    "It defines a set of methods that must be implemented in any child classes that are built on top of it.\n",
    "Key points about abstract superclasses in Python include:\n",
    "1. An abstract class contains one or more abstract methods, which are methods that have a declaration but do not have an implementation.  \n",
    "2. Abstract classes are used to define how other classes should look like, specifying the methods and properties they are expected to have.  \n",
    "3. Abstract methods and properties defined in an abstract class need to be implemented in a child class in order to create objects from it.  \n",
    "4. Python does not provide abstract classes by default, but it comes with a module called ABC (Abstract Base Classes) that allows for the creation of abstract classes.  \n",
    "5. The ABC module works by decorating methods of the base class as abstract and then registering concrete classes as implementations of the abstract base.  \n",
    "6. Abstract methods are decorated with the @abstractmethod keyword.   \n",

If the child class does not call the parent class's \\__init__ method, the parent class's attributes and methods will not be inherited by the child class. To call the parent class's \\__init__ method from the child class's \\__init__ method, the child class can use the syntax super().__init__().
