    "To support iteration in Python classes, you can use the following two operator overloading methods:  \n",
    "<b>1. iter method:</b> This method is used to define the iteration behavior of an object. It should return an iterator object and is implicitly called at the start of loops. The iterator object returned by this method should have a \\__next__ method that defines what happens in each iteration. By implementing the \\__iter__ method, you can make your class iterable, allowing it to be used in a for loop or other iteration contexts.  \n",
    "<b>2. next method:</b> This method is used to define the behavior of the iterator object returned by the \\__iter__ method. It should return the next item in the iteration sequence or raise a StopIteration exception when there are no more items to iterate over. By implementing the \\__next__ method, you can control the iteration process and provide the desired sequence of values for each iteration.  \n",

For example, if you are overloading the addition operator for a class of objects that represent numbers, the new meaning of the operator should be to add the two objects together.  \n",
