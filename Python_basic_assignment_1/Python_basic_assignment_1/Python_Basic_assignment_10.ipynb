This enables you to recover the file later if needed. However, it  doesn't free up disk space since the file remains stored on the disk.\n","\n","2. `shutil`: The shutil module provides various functions for file management tasks, including deletion. Functions like `os.remove()`, `os.unlink()`, and `shutil.rmtree()`  permanently delete files and folders. Once you use these functions, the files are gone and cannot be retrieved from the trash bin. This approach  frees up disk space."],"metadata":{"id":"aplUKrW5NN2W"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["4.ZipFile objects have a `close()` method just like File objects’ `close()` method.

The equivalent of the `open()` method for working with ZIP archives in Python is the `zipfile.ZipFile()` function.\n","\n","Here's a breakdown of the comparison:\n","\n","- File `objects.open()`: This built-in function opens a file on your system, allowing you to read from or write to it. It takes arguments like the file path and mode (\"r\" for read, \"w\" for write, etc.).\n","\n","- `zipfile.ZipFile()`: This function from the zipfile module acts similarly to `open()` but specifically for ZIP archives. It opens a ZIP file, returning a `ZipFile` object you can use to manipulate the archive's contents -  extracting files, reading information, or adding new files (depending on the mode used). It also accepts arguments like the file path and mode (\"r\" for read, \"w\" for write, \"a\" for append, etc.).\n","\n","Both functions establish a connection to a file-like object, but `zipfile.ZipFile()` caters specifically to ZIP archives, providing functionalities for working with compressed data."],"metadata":{"id":"sU4e_rY7NkmC"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["5.
